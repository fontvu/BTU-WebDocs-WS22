- About/Mission: 
  
  The number of cyberattacks in Germany is on the rise. The arrival of virtual work, Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) means companies are constantly being exposed to new vectors of attack – both on IT and OT infrastructure. In this context, the risks of data being illicitly monitored, intercepted or manipulated as well as of production stoppages are considerably higher than most businesses currently assume. 
  Many companies underestimate the dangers of cyberspace and are therefore careless and unprepared when it comes to dealing with digital risks. The damages arising from a successful cyberattack can easily be greater than the risk tolerance of the enterprise affected. We knew security could be different. They should be
  - Fast enough to keep up with dynamic threats. 
  - Intelligent enough to learn from them. 
  - Constantly evolving to keep the upper hand.

  T-800 Cybersecurity secures the most critical areas of enterprise risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data – to keep customers ahead of today’s adversaries and stop breaches. A high level of information security requires the fine-tuning of technologies and processes throughout your organisation and among your employees. From strategy through conceptualisation and implementation – we will assist you in fulfilling such prerequisites.

    - Penetration tests for online services: T-800 offers black/white box tests and code audits. During the tests, the dicussion with the development team will be held. The vulnerabilities will be presented with their proof-of-concept. The follow-up and remedial actions will be carried out by the responsible team as soon as possible.
    - Security analysis and architectural advice: During the design phase and early development stages of many projects, the security pitfalls and hidden risks can be discovered. Getting a professional advice before the coding happens usually saves a lot of efforts.
    - Training and consulting: People are your organization’s biggest asset and often the weakest link in the chain. We can provide you with real strategic insights into what form of culture and awareness initiatives should be delivered to foster more secure behaviour and bring about cyber security improvements across the whole company.
