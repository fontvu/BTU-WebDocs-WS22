    <h3>Finance and insurance</h3>

    <p>The finance and insurance industries are at the forefront of the cyber security landscape. With the increasing number of
cyber attacks, these industries have been forced to invest heavily in cyber security measures.</p>

<p>
According to a study by the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach in the finance and insurance industries is
$7.91 million. This figure is almost double the global average of $3.86 million. The study also found that the number of cyber
attacks in these industries has increased by 20% over the past year.</p>

<p>
There are a number of reasons why the finance and insurance industries are prime targets for cyber criminals. These industries
hold large amounts of customer data, which is valuable to criminals. They also rely heavily on technology, which can be vulnerable
to attack.</p>

<p>
The good news is that the finance and insurance industries are aware of the threat and are taking steps to protect themselves.
They are investing in cyber security measures, such as data encryption and intrusion detection systems. They are also educating
their employees about cyber security risks and best practices.
</p>

<p>
As the threat of cybercrime continues to grow, the finance and insurance industries will need to stay ahead of the curve
to protect their customers and their businesses.
