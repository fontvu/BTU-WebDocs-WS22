                <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
                <p>
                    The term “Cyber Security” in manufacturing refers to the security of data and information related to the manufacturing process.
                    This can include everything from the design and engineering of products to the manufacturing process itself and even the finished
                    products. In today’s interconnected world, where businesses and individuals rely heavily on technology, it’s more important than
                    ever to ensure that data and information related to manufacturing is secure.

                <h4>Finance and Insurance</h4>
                <p>
                    The finance and insurance industries are at the forefront of the cyber security landscape. With the increasing number of
                    cyber attacks, these industries have been forced to invest heavily in cyber security measures.

                <h4>Healthcare</h4>
                <p>
                    The healthcare industry is under constant attack from cybercriminals. In fact, healthcare data is now the most valuable
                    type of data on the black market, fetching up to 10 times more than financial data.1 This is because healthcare data is
                    incredibly rich and unique, containing a wealth of information that can be used to commit fraud, identity theft, and other
                    types of crimes.

                <h4>Telecommunications</h4>
                <p>
                    The ever-growing dependence on telecommunications has made cyber security in this sector increasingly important.
                    As our reliance on electronic communications grows, so too does the risk of attack by malicious actors. A successful
                    attack on a telecommunications system could have far-reaching and devastating consequences, disrupting critical
                    infrastructure and disrupting communications on a large scale.

                <h4>Retail (FMCG)</h4>
                <p>
                    The world is increasingly digitized, and retail is no exception. E-commerce has been growing rapidly, and even
                    brick-and-mortar stores are using technology more and more. This increase in technology use means that
                    retailers must be aware of and invest in cybersecurity.

                <h4>Transportation</h4>
                <p>
                    The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of our nation’s
                    transportation systems, which includes airports, seaports, railways, highways, and pipelines. In recent years,
                    the DOT has taken significant steps to improve the security of these systems against terrorist threats and other hazards.
