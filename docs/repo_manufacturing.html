    <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
    
    <p>The term “cyber security” in manufacturing refers to the security of data and information related to the manufacturing process.
This can include everything from the design and engineering of products to the manufacturing process itself and even the finished
products. In today’s interconnected world, where businesses and individuals rely heavily on technology, it’s more important than
ever to ensure that data and information related to manufacturing is secure.    </p>

<p>
There are a number of cyber security threats that manufacturing companies need to be aware of. One of the most common is cyber
espionage, which is when someone tries to gain unauthorized access to a company’s data in order to steal trade secrets or other
sensitive information. This can be done through a variety of means, such as hacking into a company’s computer systems or using
social engineering to trick employees into giving up login credentials.    </p>

<p>
Another common threat is ransomware, which is when a malicious actor encrypts a company’s data and then demands a ransom be paid
in order to decrypt it. This can be extremely costly for a company, not to mention disruptive to the manufacturing process.
    </p>
<p>
Finally, another threat that is particularly relevant to manufacturing is industrial espionage, which is when someone tries
to steal information or trade secrets in order to gain a competitive advantage. This can be done through a variety of means, such
as hacking into a company’s systems, social engineering, or even physical theft.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of steps that manufacturing companies can take to protect themselves from cyber security threats. These
include implementing strong security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as training employees
on how to spot and avoid phishing attacks. Additionally, companies should have a incident response plan in place in case of a breach.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, cyber security in manufacturing is a critical issue that companies need to be aware of. By taking steps to protect
themselves, they can help ensure that their data and information is safe from malicious actors.
