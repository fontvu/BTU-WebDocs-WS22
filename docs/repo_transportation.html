            <h3>Transportation</h3>

            <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of our
                nation’s
                transportation systems, which includes airports, seaports, railways, highways, and pipelines. In recent
                years,
                the DOT has taken significant steps to improve the security of these systems against terrorist threats
                and other hazards.</p>

            <p>
                In particular, the DOT has been working to improve the security of the transportation system against
                cyber threats.
                The DOT’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis is responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence
                information to
                support the department’s cybersecurity efforts.</p>

            <p>
                The DOT has also established the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to
                help coordinate
                the government’s response to cyber incidents. The NCCIC is a 24/7 operation that works with the private
                sector and
                other government agencies to provide information about cybersecurity threats and to help protect the
                transportation
                infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these efforts, the DOT is working on a number of other initiatives to improve the
                security of the
                transportation system against cyber threats. For example, the department is working on standards for the
                secure
                development and deployment of technology in the transportation sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DOT is also working to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and to educate the transportation
                workforce
                about how to protect against them. The department has developed a variety of training materials and
                resources,
                including an online Cybersecurity Awareness Training Course, to help address these needs.
            </p>
            <p>The DOT’s efforts to improve the security of the transportation system against cyber threats are
                important because
                the system is critical to the economy and the safety of the American people. The department’s work in
                this area will
                help to ensure that the transportation system can continue to operate safely and securely in the face of
                evolving cyber
                threats.</p>
