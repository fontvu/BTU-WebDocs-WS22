        <h1>Transportation</h1>

        <div class="imagespacer" style="background-image: url('/BTU-WebDocs-WS22/Images/server_400x266.jpg')"></div>

        <p> The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of our
            nation’s transportation systems, which includes airports, seaports, railways, highways, and pipelines. In recent
            years, the DOT has taken significant steps to improve the security of these systems against terrorist threats
            and other hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, the DOT has been working to improve the security of the transportation system against
            cyber threats. The DOT’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis is responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence
            information to support the department’s cybersecurity efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DOT has also established the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to
            help coordinate the government’s response to cyber incidents. The NCCIC is a 24/7 operation that works with the private
            sector and other government agencies to provide information about cybersecurity threats and to help protect the
            transportation infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these efforts, the DOT is working on a number of other initiatives to improve the
            security of the transportation system against cyber threats. For example, the department is working on standards for the
            secure development and deployment of technology in the transportation sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DOT is also working to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and to educate the transportation
            workforce about how to protect against them. The department has developed a variety of training materials and
            resources, including an online Cybersecurity Awareness Training Course, to help address these needs.
        </p>
        <p>The DOT’s efforts to improve the security of the transportation system against cyber threats are
            important because the system is critical to the economy and the safety of the American people. The department’s work in
            this area will help to ensure that the transportation system can continue to operate safely and securely in the face of
            evolving cyber threats.
