    <h3>Retail (FMCG)</h3>

    <p>The world is increasingly digitized, and retail is no exception. E-commerce has been growing rapidly, and even
brick-and-mortar stores are using technology more and more. This increase in technology use means that
retailers must be aware of and invest in cybersecurity.</p>

<p>
The retail industry is a tempting target for cybercriminals. Retailers hold a lot of personal and financial
data, and they are often seen as easy targets. A successful attack can result in the loss of this data, which
can be used to commit identity theft and fraud. Additionally, a cyberattack can disrupt operations and damage
the retailerâ€™s reputation.</p>

<p>
There are several steps that retailers can take to improve their cybersecurity. They should start by doing a risk
assessment to identify their vulnerabilities. They should then put in place a robust security infrastructure, including
firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption. Retailers should also train their employees in
cybersecurity best practices and make sure they have policies and procedures in place to deal with a security breach.
    </p>
<p>
Cybersecurity is an important part of doing business in the modern world, and retailers must take it seriously.
By taking steps to assess their risks and implement strong security measures, they can protect their data and their
operations from the threat of cybercrime.
