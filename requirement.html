<h3>2 Get prepared</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Find (a) team partner(s)</strong>. Team up with other(s) from the course and announce on the forum. <span style="color: red">IMPORTANT!</span> There is a set of <a href="https://www.b-tu.de/elearning/btu/mod/page/view.php?id=404365">rules for team partnering</a>,
            please read them carefully, they are flexible enough but have strict deadlines if you want to change your partner(s).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Setup your GitHub repository</strong>. For assignment 2a, 2b and 2c it is mandatory to use the code repository service
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for creating an open source repo that allows sharing your deliverables and publishing the website online. <span style="color: red">IMPORTANT!</span> Learn the
            <a href="https://www.b-tu.de/elearning/btu/mod/page/view.php?id=404366">correct way to setup and use GitHub in this course</a> before you get started with your assignment. This is also important for your grade, since your contributions
            and communication will be tracked during grading.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Choose a business</strong>. You can either choose an existing organisation if it doesn't have a website yet, or, alternatively, you can make up (invent) an organisation for this assignment. The business may be a small company in an area
            to which you feel related or are familiar; e.g. selling special equipment or offering special services; a sport club, music club, etc.; an environmental group, charity or social welfare association.</p>
    </li>

</ol>

<h3>3 Develop a business description</h3>
<p>Write up a <em>business description</em> that helps your web developer(s) to understand your organisation, including what it does and how it wants to be portrayed to the public. The description must be succinct and clear, and should help</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1668450536423_49">
    <li>
        <p>you, as the client, to understand your own project, and,</p>
    </li>
    <li id="yui_3_17_2_1_1668450536423_48">
        <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1668450536423_47">your developer(s) in making design decisions.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The business description should include:</p>


<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p>The official name of your business. (*)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Where the business office(s) is/are located, including the address of the headquarter(s) and branches (for a potential "<em>Contact</em>" page). Even if the business is a purely online&nbsp;business, it needs to show a physical presence in order
            to create credibility. (*)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Contact information: email, phone numbers, social media accounts, etc. (*).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>A brief portrait of your business for an "<em>About</em>" page. This should include a description of its <em>mission</em>. (*)<br></p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Product, services and/or business activities, describing how they are to be supported by the new website. (*)<br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><em>User personas</em> of the main users/customers of the new website. A user persona is a semi-fictional character created based on your knowledge of your current, or ideal, user/customer. <strong>Create two user personas distinguishing clearly two different user profiles, based on behaviour, interests, needs, desires</strong>,
            etc. using this
            <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">guide on personas</a>&nbsp;and this&nbsp;<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/understand-and-define-users-with-the-user-profile-model-f242047faaa9" target="_blank">guide on user profiles</a>.
            (*)
            <br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Any other relevant information that helps the web developer(s).
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>* Mandatory items.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>4 Elaborate website requirements</h3>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p><strong>Make a list of all webpages</strong>. Including at least 7/
            10/<strong>13</strong> webpages for a team of 1/2/<strong>3</strong> members, and at most 20. For each planned webpage provide</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a file name,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a title (for the <code>title</code> element),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a description of the text and pictures/images to include, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a description of the functionality, if pertinent.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list of four columns should be delivered in the form of a table in an HTML file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Make a website design diagram</strong>. Specify the website's views, areas and pages using the method described in the lecture slides about
            <em>Website Design</em>. Create the website design diagram using
            <a href="https://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, a tool for creating <em>wireframes</em> online and collaboratively, and that allows you to export your design to PDF format files.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Make sure to include 2/3/<strong>4</strong> of the following items for a team of 1/2/<strong>3</strong> members on your website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a page based on an <strong>XML data file</strong>, such as an address list or a product list,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>one or more <strong>SVG image</strong>s, such as a logo, icons, decorative graphics, etc.,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>audio</strong> or <strong>video</strong>&nbsp;files or web links to streaming services. Find instructions for embedding&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en">YouTube</a>,
                    <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed">Twitch</a>,
                    <a href="https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/224969968-Embedding-videos-overview">Vimeo</a>,
                    <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003566828-The-Visual-embedded-player-">SoundCloud</a>,
                    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/embed/">Spotify</a>,
                    <a href="https://widget.deezer.com/">Deezer</a>, etc.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Elaborate visual style</strong>. Delineate how the website should <em>look and feel</em>: colors, fonts, layout, decorative elements, etc.</p>
    </li>

</ol>

<h3>5 Prepare website content</h3>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p><strong>Choose a domain name</strong>, and share the link to the domain checker showing that the domain is still available. Go to <a href="https://www.name.com/">Name.com</a>, find a suitable domain available, and include the link in your assignment
            submission. Look at this example of a <a href="https://www.name.com/domain/search/abcexampleabc.com">link to
      a
      domain checker</a> showing availability. There is no need to buy a domain, but you are free to do it if you want.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Create text</strong>, enough to fill up all the pages with at least two paragraphs with realistic text, <strong>avoiding always</strong> pages that uniquely contain images; if not centric, text must be an important part of every web page.
            Therefore, never use placeholder (fake or filler) text.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Create or collect images</strong>, read our
            <a href="https://www.b-tu.de/elearning/btu/mod/page/view.php?id=404367" target="_blank">
      guide to use images on the Web</a> and learn how to properly get and use images in your project. You must provide credits for all images, stating which license applies to which image, either in the footer of the page where the image
            is used, or on a special <kbd>credits.html</kbd> page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Provide the business logo</strong>. Consider to design a logo for free with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo">Adobe Spark</a>. The logo may be provided as an image file, to be marked up as an SVG file, being an item of
            4c.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Provide files/data/web links of items to markup/embed in 4c</strong>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span>: your website should not include interactive elements, such as forms or widgets. Therefore, you should disregard e-commerce/app-alike features and focus exclusively on content presentation and consumption.</p>
<h3>6 Deliverables</h3>
<p>You submit the link to the (centralised and unique) group's GitHub repo, which must include the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><kbd>README.md</kbd>, with information of the web developer(s), such as names &amp; GitHub usernames, page with business description, website requirements and website content.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create individual folders for each assignment part: "<kbd>assignment-2a</kbd>", "<kbd>assignment-2b</kbd>", "<kbd>assignment-2c</kbd>".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In your folder <kbd>assignment-2a</kbd>, create a subfolder <kbd>website-content</kbd> and include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a list of all webpages, <kbd>webpages-list.html</kbd>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a website design diagram, <kbd>website-design-diagram.pdf</kbd>, generated with Balsamiq.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>data/images/video/audio files, as defined in 4c.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>For this assignment there is no need for individual submissions, since assignment submission has been set for <strong>group submission</strong>, therefore it suffices if only one member submits a group's work.</p>
